This is a database for my Ristaurante Con Fusion app, here we have the dishes, the comments, the feedback the leaders and the promotions informations.

As the only hoster i found for free that could give me some JSON functionallities out there was vercel, i ended up using it but with it can't use POST method, so the user cant post comments or feedback. Any idea of a better hoster would be welcome here.

There's also another bug with vercel, i dont know why but when the user refreshes the page the browser returns 404, this isnt happening in local environment, so i dont know why its happening there.
